This is a custom built darts calculator and score keeping Application.

It is currently still in development with the current focus being on the front end. 

Currently there are 3 Game Modes:
- Standard 501 Darts
- Cricket
- Around The Board

Standard 501 Darts
- Like you see on the TV.
- Finish on double or bull.

In the Cricket Game mode each player races each other to tick off each number and bull. 
- You are given a tally of 3 for each number from 15-20, and 3 for Bull, 
- You have to hit each number 3 times, or hit a double and a single, or one triple. (triples = 3, doubles = 2). You must do the same for Bull where 50 = 2 hits and 25 = 1 hit. 
- The first player to clear their tally wins. 

Around The Board Game mode. Where users start at 1 and race eachother to be the first to hit 20. 

Future Game Modes:
- Practise mode
- Killer
