This is a custom built darts calculator and score keeping Application.

It is currently still in development with the current focus being on the front end. 

The Application currently handles 2 players playing the Cricket Game mode where each player races each other to tick off each number and bull. 
- You are given a tally of 3 for each number from 15-20, and 3 for Bull, 
- You have to hit each number 3 times, or hit a double and a single, or one triple. (triples = 3, doubles = 2). You must do the same for Bull where 50 = 2 hits and 25 = 1 hit. 
- The first player to clear their tally wins. 

Currently I am working on an Around The Board Game mode. Where users start at 1 and race eachother to be the first to hit 20. 

Before Christmas I had an over engineered solution which was not fully functional, so next steps are to simplify and redo this game mode. 


The final Game mode, will be Standard 501 darts where the user can input their scores after every turn and will have to check out with a double. For the desktop version of this I will reuse the gameboard component from the cricket mode and add the calculations.

Future iterations of this project will include a user page, scoreboards, a practise mode, will be responsive and will have a database to track games over time.
